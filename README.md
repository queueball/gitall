# Overview

`gitall` will run a bunch of operations on several directories containing git repositories at once. This can be used to check the status on multiple repos at
once or apply a change or action to multiple repos at once.

# Notes

The paths are specified in `~/.gitall.json`

```
{
  "paths": [
    "/path/one",
    "~/path/two",
    ...
  ]
}
```
